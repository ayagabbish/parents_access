# parents_access
we made this project as a simple example to improve internet safety for children
## main idea
If a *child* would like access to social media, he must get the mother's or father's *face ID* in order to access it. As awareness for the parent to know that their child is using social media.

## How it operates
if the cild tries to access social media without the parents face ID, the access will be denied. throw an if statment, in this project we presented that action in the movment of the servomotor, when the access is denied the servo would move to the left followed by a turn to the right in a form of a "no".

if the child has his/her parents' approval, the program with give them access to social media. In this specific project, the servo will move up then down in form of a "yes".
