## Main Idea

If a *child* would like access to a device, he must get his/her mother's or father's *face ID* in order to access it. As awareness for the parent to know that their child is using a device.

## How it operates
If the child tries to access a device without the parent's face ID, access will be put in child saftey mode. In this project, we presented that action in the movement of the servomotor, the servo would move to the left, followed by a turn to the right in a form of a "no".

If the program identefies the child the programe will put the device on childe mode

If the program didn't identify the user, it would make a buzzer sound and deny access for the user.
